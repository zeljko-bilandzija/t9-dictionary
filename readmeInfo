*** T9 predictive word converter Task ***

*** REQUIREMENTS & INSTALLATION ***

This task has following requirements that has to be installed on machine:
  - NodeJS v.10.0.0

*** Backend part ***

I assumed that dictionary will be static file which lives in root directory of server.
I used config.json which wouldn't be part of github project in production,
and here is serve just as example for configuring certain app properties.
Also, I used routes.json, which is not needed, but this is simple way for 
documenting available routes for API users.
For installation all required modules you need to go to folder 'backend', 
open command promt/terminal and run "npm install" command.
For run project you need to run command "npm run start" for Node or "npm run start-watch" for Nodemon.
For test project you need to run command "npm run test" or "npm run test-watch".
Backend project has been written from scratch. 

*** Frontend part ***

For installation all required modules you need to go to folder 'frontend', 
open command promt/terminal and run "npm install" command.
For run project you need to run command "npm start".
Sample projects fetch words from backend and show first one, 
and with cycle button you can cycle founded words.
Frontend project has been written with create-react-app tool.

*** Other ***

I hope that this sample project will be good enough, and I am sure 
that some of requirements like ones in this sample project, you are working on different 
and much better way, but I would be happy to see, learn and use better approaches.

Thanks
